all subnets in default VPC have a route out to the internet.

VPC peering
* allows you to connect one VPC with another via a direct network route using private IP addresses.
* instances behave as if they were on the same private network.
* you can peer VPC's with other AWS accounts as weel as with other VPCs in the same account.
* no transitive peering.

only one internet gateway per vpc.
NAT gateway for each AZ.

NAT instance can be used as a bastion server. 다른 장비로 들어가기 위한 징검다리.


## NAT instance
* when creating a NAT instance, Disable Source / Destination Check on the instance.
* NAT instances must be in a public subnet.
* There must be a route out of the private subnet to the NAT instace, in order for this to work.
* The amount of traffic that NAT instances can support depends on the instance size. if you are bottlenecking, increase the instance size.
* you can create high availability using Autoscaling Groups, multiple subnets in different AZs, and a script to automate failover.
* Nat instances are behind security groups.

## NAT gateway
* preferred by the enterprise.
* scale automatically up to 10GBps
* No need to patch
* Not associated with security groups
* automatically assigned a public ip address
* remember to update your route table.
* no need to disable source / destination checks.


for private ACL, every inbound is denied by default.

default network ACL allows all outbound and inbound traffic by default.
custom network ACL denies all inbound and outbound until you add rules.
each subnet in your VPC must be associated with a network ACL. default acl is associated with subnet.
a NACL can be associated with multiple subnets. but a subnet can have only one NACL.
ACL은 숫자가 작은 것부터 순서대로 정렬된 리스트.
NACL is stateless; responses to allowed inbound are subject to the rules for outbound traffic.
blocking IP addresses is available with NACL not security groups.


## VPC Flow logs
enables you to capture information about the IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in your VPC. <br/>
After VPC flow logs are created, you can view and retrieve its data in Amazon CloudWatch Logs. <br/>
can be created in three levels: 1) VPC 2) Subnet 3) Network Interface Level <br />
You cannot enable flow logs for VPCs that are peerd with your VPC unless it is in your account. <br/>
can't tag a flow log <br/>
after it is created, you cannot change its configuration.


## NAT vs Bastion
* NAT: provide internet traffic to EC2 instances in private subnets.
* Bastion: securely administer EC2 instances, with RDP...


at least two subnets are required for ALB.
