* By default, all newly created buckets are PRIVATE.
* You can setup accessl control to your buckets using 1) Bucket Policies 2) Access Control Lists.
* S3 buckets can be configured to create access logs which log all requests made to the S3 bucket. This can be done to another bucket.

==> SSL/TLS

2. At Rest
