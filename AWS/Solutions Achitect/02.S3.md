## Simple Storage Service

0. Exam Tips
* Buckets are a universal name space
* upload an object to S3 receive a HTTP 200 code
* S3, S3-IA, S3 Reduced Redundancy Storage
* Encryption: Client, Server side Encryption
* control access to buckets using either a bucket ACL or using Bucket Policies
* by default, buckets are private and all objectes are stored inside them are private.

* stores all versions of an object
* great backup tool
* once enabled, versioning cannot be disabled, only suspended.
* integrates with lifecycle rules
* versioning's MFA Delete capability, which uses multi-factor authentication, can be used to provide an additional layer of security.

* Versioning must be enabled on both the source and destination buckets.
* regions must be unique.
* files in an existing bucket are not replicated automatically. All subsequent updated files will be replicated automatically.
* You cannot replicate to multiple buckets or user daisy chaining.
* Delete markers are not replicated.
* Deleting individual versions or delete markers will not be replicated.

* Lifecycle management can be used in conjunction with versioning.
* can be applied to current versions and previous versions.
* Following can now be done:
\ - Transition to the Standard - IA Storage class (30 days after the creation date)
\ - Archive to the Glacier 30 days after IA
\ - Permanently Delete

1. 특징
1.1. Basic
* Object-based: allows you to upload files.
* Each file can be from 0 byte to 5 TB.
* unlimited storage
* stored in Bucket, not directory. 
* S3's name should be globally unique.
* if the upload succeed, you will get HTTP 200 response.


1.2. Data Consistency Model for S3
* Read after Write consistency model for PUTS of new objects.
* Eventual Consitency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES (can take few minutes)


1.3. S3 == KVS
* Object: Key + Value + VersionID + MetaData (tag...) + Subresources (ACL, Torrent)

1.4. 기능
* Tiered Storage
* Lifecycle management
* Versioning
* Encryption
* Secured by ACL and Bucket policies

* S3 to host STATIC websites.
* scales automatically to meet your demand. movie trailer.


2. Tiered Storage
2.1. S3 Standard
* 99.9% Availability with 99.999999999% Durability
* stored redundantly across multiple devices (disks) in multiple facilities (AZs).
* designed to sustain the loss of 2 facilities concurrently.
2.2. S3 - IA
* For data accessed less frequently, but requires rapid access when it is retrieved. 
* Lower price than the standard, but the customer should pay the retrieval fee.
2.3. S3 - One Zone IA
* Lower cost for infrequently accessed data, but do not need the multi-facility resilience.
2.3. Glacier
* Very cheap, but for archival only.
* No Availability SLA.
* Models: Expedited, Standard or Bulk.
* Retrieval time for Standard is 3-5 hours.


3. Charges
* Storage
* Requests
* Storage Management Pricing: tags..
* Data Transfer Pricing


4. Transfer Acceleration
secure transfers of files over long distances between your end users and S3 buckets.
