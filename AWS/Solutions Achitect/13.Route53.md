## Routing Policy
* Simple routing
Only single resource that performs a given function for your domain.

* Weighted routing
들어오는 트래픽의 특정 비율은 AZ1로, 나머지는 AZ2로 나누는 식.
* latency-based routing
route your traffic based on the lowest network latency for your end user. <br />
to do this, you should create a latency resource record set for the EC2/ELB resource in each region that hosts your website.<br />
When S3 receives a query for your site, it selects the latency resource record set for the region that gives the user the lowest latency.<br />
* failover routing
Active-Passive setting based on health-checking.
* geolocation routing
어떤 지역에서 사용자가 접속하느냐에 따라 다른 서버로 보내줌.
* multivalue answer routing
route traffic randomly to multiple resources. <br />
