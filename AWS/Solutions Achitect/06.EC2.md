## EC2
resizable compute capcity in the cloud. it reduces the time required to obtain and boot new server instances to minutes, allowing you to quickly scale capacity, both up and down, as your computing requirements change.

### Exam Tips
1. 개념
* FIGHT DR MC PX
2. 실습
* one subnet == one AZ
* Termination Protection is turned off by default.
* EBS-backed instance => the root EBS is deleted when the instance is terminated.
* EBS root volumes cannot be encrypted. 3rd party solution or using API provided by AWS.
* additional volumes can be encrypted

### Options
1. On Demand: pay a fixed rate by the hour(or seconds) with no commitment.
* low cost and flexiblility of EC2 without any up-front payment.
* short-term, spiky, or unpredictable workloads.
* developed or tested for the first time.

2. Reserved: a capacity reservation, and offer a significant discount on the hourly charge for an instance. 1-3 years.
* app with steady state or predictable usage.
* reserved capacity.
* up-front payment to reduce their total computing costs even further.
 \- Standard RI: up to 75% off
 \- Convertible RI: up to 50% off. 더 많은 자원을 사용하도록 인스턴스 이미지를 수정할 수 있음.
 \- Scheduled RI: 예약한 시간 동안만 론칭. match your capacity reservation to a predictable recurring schedule.

3. Spot: enables you to bid whatever price you want for instance capacity, providing for even greater savings if your applications have flexible start and end time.
* apps that flexible start and end time.
* only feasible at very low compute prices.
* users with an urgent need for large amounts of additional computing capacity.

4. Dedicated Hosts: Physical EC2 server dedicated for your use. reduces costs by allowing you to use your existing
* Multi-tenant virtualization 를 사용하지 못하는 법적 제약이 있을 때.
* great for licensing.
* on-demand hourly.
* reservation, up to 70% discount.

### Placement Groups
* a clustered placement group can't span multiple AZs.
* a spread placement group can.
* the name you specify for a placement group must be unique within your AWS account.
* only certain types of instances can be launched in a placement group (Compute optimized, GPU, Memory optimized, Storage optimized)
* AWS recomment homogenous instances within placement groups.
* you can't merge placement groups.
* you can't move an existing instance into a placement group. you can create an AMI from your existing instance, and then launch a new instances from the AMI into a placement gruop.
