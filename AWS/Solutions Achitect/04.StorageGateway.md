* flat files in S3, pdf, words, pictures, video... stored directly to S3.
* the objects are managed as native S3 objects.

2. Volumes Gateway (iSCSI): virtual Hard disk == block storage.
* data written to these volumes can be asynchronously backed up as point-in-time snapshots of your volumes, ans stored in the cloud as Amazon EBS snapshot.
* Snapshots are incremental backups that capture only changed blocks. All snapshot storage is also compressed to minimize your storage charges.

* store your primary data locally, while asynchrnously backing up that data to AWS.

2.2. Cached volumnes

* S3 as your primary data storage while retaining frequently accessed data locally in your storage gateway.* 
* most frequently read data is in cached storage in local.

3. Tape Gateway (VTL): backup
* used for backup and uses popular backup applications like NetBackup...
* virtual tape libary interface. existing tape-based backup app infra to store data on virtual tape cartridges that you create on your tape gateway.
