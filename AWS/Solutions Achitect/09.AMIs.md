select your AMI based on
* Region
* Operating System
* Architecture (32-bit or 64-bit)
* Launch Permissions
* Storage for the root device (root device volume): 1) Instance Store (EPHEMERAL STORAGE) 2) EBS Backed volumes


All AMIs are either 1) backed up by EBS, or 2) instance store.
* For EBS: the root device for an instance launched from the AMI is an EBS volume created from an Amazon EBS snapshot.
* For Instance store: the root device launched from the AMI is an instance store volume created from a template stored in S3.


* Instance store volumes are called Ephemeral Storage.
* instance store volumes cannot be stopped. if the underlying host fails, you will lose your data.
* EBS backed instance can be stopped. You will not lose the data on this instance if it is stopped.
* both ROOT volumes will be deleted on termination, however with EBS volumes, you can tell AWS to keep it.
