## Lambda
* a compute service where you can upload your code and create a Lambda function. AWS Lambda takes care of provisioning and managing the servers that you use to run the code.
* as an event-driven compute service where AWS Lambda runs your code in response to events. They can be changes to data in an S3 bucket or an DynamoDB.
* as a compute service to run your code in reponse to HTTP requests using Amazon API Gateway or API calls made using AWS SDKs. \


### Price
1. Number of requests
- first million requests are free.
- 0.2$ per 1 million requests.

2. Duration
- max 5min.
- 코드가 실제 실행된 시간. 그 시간 동안 사용한 메모리의 양을 기준으로 청구됨.


* lambda scales out automatically
* lambda functions are independent, 1 event = 1 function
* lambda is serverless by itself.
* know what services are serverless: S3, API gateway, DynamoDB
* lambda functions can trigger other lambda.
* AWS X-ray to degug since the architecture gets too complicated.
* lambda can do things globally, you can use it to back up S3 buckets to other S3 buckets etc.
* Know your triggers.
