## Elastic Load Balancers

Virtual Appliance, balances the load of web application.
if the EC2 at the back is not responding, ELB does not send any request to it.

### Types
1. Application load balancer
* best suited for HTTP and HTTPS traffic.
* operate at layer 7 and are application-aware.
* create advanced request routing, sending specified requests to specific web servers.

2. Network load balancer: for extreme performance.
* best suited for TCP traffic where extreme performance is required.
* operate at connection level (level 4)
* handling millions of requests per second, while maintaining ultra-low latencies.

3. Classic load balancer
* legacy ELB.
* HTTP/HTTPS apps 
* use layer 7 specific features, X-Forwarded and stickey sessions.
* strict layer 4 balancing for apps that rely purely on the TCP protocol.
* 504 error, app stopped responding. the gateway is timed out.
==> troubleshoot if it is the webserver or database server.
* X-Forwarded-For header: when you need IPv4 address of your end user.


### Health Checks
* Instances are monitored by ELB are reported as: InService or OutOfService.
* HC check the instance health by talking to it.
* Have their own DNS name. You are never given an IP address.
